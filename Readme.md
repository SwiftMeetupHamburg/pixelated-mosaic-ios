# Mosaic Pixelated Client for iOS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mosaicapp/pixelated-mosaic-ios.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mosaicapp/pixelated-mosaic-ios)

Mosaic is an open source iOS client for [Pixelated](https://www.pixelated-project.org), an open source email system that makes sending and receiving GPG encrypted emails dead-simple. Mosaic is developed using Swift and is still in a very early phase of development. Our goal is to implement an iOS client for Pixelated, that's easy to use and offers access to the most important features of Pixelated.
